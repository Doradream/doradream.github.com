          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Why I designed this research</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">China’s online education industry has grown rapidly in the past few years, and analysts believe the country could become one of the world’s most vibrant online education markets in the future. The market is likely to grow 20 per cent annually, reaching 270 billion yuan (US$41 billion) in 2019, up from 156 billion yuan in 2016. Globally the online education market will rise to US$190 billion by 2019, statistics from iResearch and Decebo showed. This means big opportunities for online education companies in China.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">In 2016, Dianping app established an education channel, which is also a platform form. Its core function is to match teaching institutions and adult learners in four major areas: higher education, vocational training, language learning and hobby education. At the beginning of 2017, we have preliminary products, but we are still exploring how to optimize our products and improve the user experience.</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">How I designed this questionnaire</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Project Plan: online survey, web analytics, interview and building persona and journey map. This article mainly focuses on the online survey phase.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As the research initiator, I designed an online survey with a product manager’s help, and then analyzed data and reported findings in education department.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Try to define these questions to find and appeal to current users:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="pj1-p-normal"> Who are our users?</p></li>
            <li><p class="pj1-p-normal"> How do the users make decisions when choosing a course?</p></li>
          </ul>



          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Questionnaire construction</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I used basic AIDA model (Awareness→ Interest→ Desire→ Action) to present users purchasing process. We focused on the pre-purchase stage (i.e. attention, interest and desire) as our product team’s priority optimization at that time.</p>
          <p>
            <img width="680" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./survey_files/survey construction.png">
          </p>
          <p class="st">The AIDA Purchase model and survey construction</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Then I collected and designed questions from PM and business department by conducting a preliminary research. A questionnaire piloting followed to fix some confusing questions.</p>
        

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Data colletction and validity</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The survey is administrated by app push notifications to 4.95 million education channel users who has recent purchase, booking, high preference or visit in last 180 days. Scan QR code or visit this website to view questionnaire in Chinese.</p>

        <div class="w-row">
          <div class="w-col w-col-9">
            <p class="pj1-p-normal">In two weeks, I recovered 583 responses, among which 453 are valid sample data and 303 are used for user group analysis by using cross analysis, frequency analysis and k-means cluster analysis.</p>
            <p class="pj1-p-normal">After cleaning the data, I compared it to big data user report of Education Channel, the overall characteristics of sample data are similar to those of the big data user report. Meanwhile, the survey is administrated by app push notifications and targets on users who are interested in or have participated in our educational products. As a result, this survey cannot cover churn users and other potential users.</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Overall characteristics</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I designed this infographic to help stakeholders better understand general characteristics of sample data.</p>
          <p>

          <p class="st">Infographic of general characteristics</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Find the right user groups</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">According to business needs, I divided users by their learning goals and subjects with Tableau which uses the k-means algorithm for clustering. When k equals five, the cluster is aligned with business needs at a reasonable level.</p><br>
          <p><img width="800" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./survey_files/key variables.png"></p>
          <p class="st">Variable for clustering</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Due to the small size of user group 5 which contains all the scattered grey categories as in the picture below, I later focused on the analysis of other four groups which are named after their goal and subject.</p><br>
          <p><img width="800" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./survey_files/five clusters.png"></p>
          <p class="st">Five clusters under the view of learning goal and subject</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">After analyzing our monthly UV and revenue in May, I set Music, art-hobby as primary user group, Language-ability as secondary and Vocation-test and vocation-ability as supplemental.</p>

          <p class="st">Define the importance of user groups by UV and revenue</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Findings</h2>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">How do users know about the course? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Attention phase</span></h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">
          All groups with more than 40% participants were aware of the course by searching information online, and Music, art-hobby group with 56% users especially got the information this way. Meanwhile, 34% of Vocation-ability group heard of the course by recommendation of friends.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">How do users learn more about the course? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Interest phase</span></h3>
          	<p class="pj1-p-normal">
          When asked how did they learn more about the course that they were interested in, 76% of Music, art-hobby group participated in trail courses and more than 40% of all groups searched online for more information.</p>

		<h3 class="pj-h3">How many educational institutions do users consider? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Desire phase</span></h3>
		<p class="pj1-p-normal">More than 96% of all participants considered less than five institutions when choosing a course.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">What learning approaches do users prefer? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Desire phase</span></h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">
          More than half of all groups preferred face to face class. 79% participants of Music, art-hobby group especially like this kind of on-site class, while Vocation-test group have more people like video and live video courses.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">What do users care most about educational institutions? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Desire phase</span></h3>
          	<p class="pj1-p-normal">
          Music, art-hobby group care about distance and transportation, word of mouth and available trial courses most when choosing institutions. All groups care about word of mouth a lot.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">What do users care most about teachers? -- <span style="color: #44c7b4;">Desire phase</span></h3>
          	<p class="pj1-p-normal">
           All groups care about teacher’s professional and teaching ability a lot. While 57% of Music, art-hobby group consider teacher’s word of mouth important and 15% of Language-ability group think teacher’s nationality is important.</p><br>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">
          When it comes to what users care most about a course, the top three factors that all groups mention are teaching effectiveness, price and course content. It's worth noting that Music, art-hobby group care most about distance and vocation-ability group also care about institution brand as the third factor.</p><br>

          <p class="st">Sequence of factors that users care about courses</p>


          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">What we plan to do about the survey result</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Combined the results with available app analytics data to find more insights. For example, how many institutions dose a typical user view before purchasing, which section dose he tap most often to approach our service in app, which page does he stay longer and check more sections among course page, institution page and teacher page?</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Use these result as benchmarks for follow-up studies to find out the reason behind their attitudes and behaviors and test the findings.</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Make a difference</h2>
          <h3 class="pj-h3">Expand design influence by advocating the result to the whole department</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">This survey laid the foundation of building our persona and arose the awareness of our users in non-design teams as our design team’s first try. As an UX designer, I used to attend the weekly product meeting to understand real-time product trends. They listened attentively to my preaching of the survey result at the weekly meeting because it was exactly what the educational product department needed. I used powerful instrument--data visualization (e.g. dashboard, infographic and visual graphics) to help stakeholders understand and address user needs. The product team considered this survey helpful for their future product planning.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Try to put the research results into practical activities</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The business department tried an offline activity called Knows Market which gathered all of our popular educational institutions in music, art and other hobby field and provided on-site trail courses. Users can sign up online and participate offline. It is a successful try to reach our primary user group as they care a lot about trail course and teaching effectiveness.</p><br>

          <p><img width="500" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./survey_files/knows market.png"></p>
          <p class="st">Knows Market activity</p>


          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">How can I do better in the future?</h2>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Increase recovery rate to make best use of the data</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Usually the common recovery rate of online questionnaire in our app is one in a thousand, while we got a low recovery rate of 1.2 responses per ten thousand. The result would be much better if I could strive for better distribution channels of push notification since our design team hadn’t cooperated with internal messaging team for a long time. A better distribution timing would also make a difference. I investigated the UV pattern for educational channel users and selected the peak period of visits during a week, but I ignored other competitors at the same distribution channel who might send different questionnaires to same users.</p>


          <h3 class="pj-h3">Design the questionnaire better and faster</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Because of the time limit, I designed this survey by interviewing two PMs who had collected possible questions from educational institutions. Interviewing some extreme users and analyzing user behavioral data would give me more inspirations for the designing phase of survey.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Making sure all possible supports and resources that my research needs are ready before actually starting the project would accelerate the whole process.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Use a more holistic consumer’s purchase decision model</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">A major deficiency of AIDA purchase model is the absence of post-purchase effects such as satisfaction, repeat patronage behavior or participating in online product reviews, though this model met our needs of re-purchase stage at that time. The purchasing decision model (Problem Recognition →Information search →Alternative evaluation →Purchase decision →Post-purchase), combined with the internet’s impact on buying process, is a more comprehensive model that will communicate more insights of the whole customer experience.</p>
