        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Overview</h2>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Besides interview, questionnaire, user testing and usability testing and contextual inquiry, I also used data-driven methods to get more insights to inform design, such as website &amp; app data analysis (e.g., user funnel, conversion rate), questionnaire analysis (e.g., cluster analysis, open-ended question analysis) and data visualization (e.g., dashboard, infographic). My experience as a product manager made me good at Excel, GA, Tableau and R for analyzing open-ended questionnaire. </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I'll introduce two projects to show some interesting research process: Dianping education homepage redesign and JD.COM promotional game data analysis.</p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Project 1 - User Research of Dianping Education Homepage Redesign</h2>
       
          <h3 class="pj-h21">Backgroud</h3>


          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As a new product established for half a year, we tried to expand our business by redesigning and adding new features and functions in early 2017 (such as live steaming video, teacher's personal page, promotional page). We had business analysis team's support, mainly providing our product team some business data about conversions and revenues, but we never analyze any user behavior data before. At that time, we planned to redesign our homepage to better meet our business needs, and I proposed to analyze user behavioral data to get more insight as a part of the plan of getting to know our users (the project of dianping education survey is also a part of this plan, see more details in that project about the plan).</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h21">How to collect app user data for design purpose?</h3>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Create the user path </span></h3>

            <p>
              <img width="800" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/userpath.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The user path shows how users flow from pages to pages. They go through homepage, middle page, intention page and conversion page, until they decide to reserve or purchase a product. What I needed was the data of each page and features. The darker the background color of the pages are, the more likely the users will be converted.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Horizontal -- Competitive analysis of sibling channels in our app</span></h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Dianping was a platform that has a lot of different channels which were built within one year and shared the same users. I gathered channel homepage data from Parent-child, Beauty, Marriage, Home renovation department to compare the feature conversion rate, figuring out if there was growth space and what was our channel's performance.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Vertical -- Extract data from BA system</span></h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">It depends on what we want to know about the users. Besides the final conversion rate, I worked with our business analysis department to define some dimensions and metrics. Out of curiosity, I asked them to provide an additional dimension to better comparison - the reverse user path which means the data of users who are converted and non-converted.</p>

      <div class="greybox">
        <p class="pj1-p-normal">The data I extracted from BA department:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Dimensions: date, item type, user type (converted or not), feature, page</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Metrics: UV (click +view), PV (click +view), CTR, reservation user, transaction, dwell time, bounce rate</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2 class="pj-h21">App data analysis</h2>
          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Homepage conversion</span></h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/channelconversion.png">
            </p>
            <p>
              <img width="800" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/conversion.png">
            </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The charts above show click-through rate of five channel homepages and conversion rate of our channel. The data came from daily average of one week in April 2017.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Let's take a closer look at each feature.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;"></span></h3>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Search </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/1.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Horizontal: According to the different interfaces, the wider search bar contributes to higher click-through rate (CTR). Marriage and Parent-child channel with smaller search icon on the upper right corner have lower click-through rate.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Vertical: This feature has 7.8% click-through rate in homepage, the fourth high rate. But the ratio of every user who goes to intention page (0.81) and reserves a product (3.1%) that comes from this feature is relatively high, comparing to each mean metric of main features.</p>


          <h3 class="pj-h3">2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Navigation Icon </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/2.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Horizontal: Compared to similar interfaces with beauty and marriage channel, CTR of our channel is good. They are all located in the upper half of first screen. It is noteworthy that the similar two-tier layout of navigation in home renovation and parent-child channel has different CTR. The second-tier navigation of parent-child channel takes up twice as much space as the one of home renovation channel, resulting much higher CTR in 2nd-tier navigation but lower CTR in 1st-tier navigation.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Vertical: This feature has the highest CTR with 57% in homepage, and is effective to lead user to intention page and reservation.</p>



          <h3 class="pj-h3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion Area </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/3.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Horizontal: We had a much higher CTR of this feature under the same layout. Assume that we had really good promotion activities than others. Another interesting thing I found was that only beauty channel put this feature in the second screen, but it has a CTR of 12.1% which is not much lower than other channels in my assumption.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Vertical: However, its effect of leading users to intention pages is so low with 0.13, but it has the highest purchasing rate and a high reservation rate which is understandable, because items in promotion result page usually are trail courses with low price. When I looked at the three promotion areas separately, I found 78% of the traffic goes to the lower right corner promotion -free gift zoon. </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As in the picture below, the rest two promotion areas generate 7.8% CTR which is much lower than other channels. We needed to exam our promotion activities.</p>
            <p>
              <img width="300" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/promotion.png">
            </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Another problem was that the free gift page didn't linked to any intention pages, and users usually participant in this activity then leave this page. With such a high CTR of this area, we need to figure out how to guide this traffic reasonably. </p>


          <h3 class="pj-h3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;Leaderboards </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/4.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Horizontal: Compared to the leaderboards in beauty channel, our leaderboard looks much less like an advertisement, which gives user the feeling of authority, resulting in a higher CTR.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Vertical: It has low rates to intention page and purchase, but the highest reservation rate. A lot of users who believes in authority would like to use this feature.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">A closer look at these three leaderboards shows that CTR decreases from left to right.</p>
            <p>
              <img width="300" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/leaderboards.png">
            </p>




          <h3 class="pj-h3">5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Hot items </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/5.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Horizontal: All hot items feature in different channel are located in the second screen or below. Compared to similar layout of marriage and parent-child channel, our feature has a low CTR of 10.5%, which may not be a bad result but mean we convert more user in the first screen. We should carefully exam the CTR in future iterations. It is worth to note that the hot items area in beauty and home renovation channel has a much lower CTR with a relatively lower position in the second screen. According to the previous comparisons, their upper content in the page doesn't excel too much. Thus, they need to carefully consider if the layout is friendly to users who just want to look around without specific intentions.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Vertical: This feature has the third high CTR of 10.3%, and the highest intention page conversion of 1.1, but its conversion to reservation and purchase is low. This may be a sign of weak hot items area and intention page design: users go to intention pages while they could find the information they need, so they leave, resulting in low conversion rate. We may apply BI system here to accurately lead traffic to intention pages in the future.</p>


          <h3 class="pj-h3">6 &nbsp;&nbsp;Occasional activities </h3>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/6.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Compared to other channels, we had a higher CTR of this occasional promotion area, which mean our visual design and advertising slogan is working well. However, these activities vary over time, so the best way to evaluate this kind of feature is to evaluate each one separately. Consider their online and offline advertising resources, main conversion metrics and input-output ratio.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Converted vs. non-converted user metrics</span></h3>

            <p>
              <img width="780" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./data_files/metrics.png">
            </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Converted users means users who reserved or purchased a product on that day. Of all users who visit our homepage, the daily average browse UV percentage in one week of converted users is about 2%.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The table tells us that converted users have longer dwell time in homepage and intension pages, half bounce rate and double click PV per user in homepage. These metrics seem to be obvious, but once we start to monitor them over iterations and find out what really attracts these converted users in each page, we would have a better sense of what is a better metric, thus use these metrics to better guide our design.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">What's next</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">We couldn't complete the homepage redesign project because of product strategic realignment. But I considered this as a good starter for our team to starting caring about design metrics. Based on those data model I created, we'll accumulate more data through each iteration over time and better evaluate user experience along with other research methods. </p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Project 2 - JD.COM promotional game data analysis</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">JD.com, as an e-commerce company, has a business-focused organizational structure. Our design team, product team and tech team directly response to business team who usually makes the promotional requirements. Thus, the metrics we cared about were most about business performance. I built promotional game data models of conversion rate and user funnel to get a better sense of promotion effect on user experience in JD.com in early 2016. This was a new attempt for all departments. I was recognized by team leader for innovation and impact on team's efforts later because of this.</p>
