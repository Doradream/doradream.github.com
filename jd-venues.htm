        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Background</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">June 18th is the birthday of JD.com (a Chinese e-commerce giant company), but also the day of a fierce promotional war in e-commerce markets in the middle of a year, together with November 11 ( the Single's day) and Chinese New Year festival, they forming the e-commerce market where giant companies, such as Alibaba, must contend. The promotion lasts for nearly one month in June is known as JD 618 by Chinese people. </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Our design team was a newly established team and responsible for the design of 618 app promotions in 2016. The ultimate goal was to allow app users to better understand the promotion activities, increase the user's interest in the promotion, and enhance the user's promotion experience.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">In 2016ï¼Œthe total order of JD 618 is over one hundred million, of which 85% is on the mobile terminal. I appreciated that our team had this great opportunity to design for our app users and contributed to this inspiring result.</p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Overview</h2>

            <p>
              <img width="700" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/twokinds.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">This project will focus on promotion venues design.</p>


            <p>
              <img width="700" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/roles.png">
            </p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">User characteristics</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">User research team helped us recognize the characteristics of users who often participate in promotions in JD app. We got over 4,000 responses of an online questionnaire and had interviewed 6 participants. Combined with the previous cumulated promotion persona data, our department had a general understanding of the users involved in the promotion.</p>

            <p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Define top three pain points in the promotion buying process | Key scenario</h2>
            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/scenario.png">
            </p>
            <p>
              <img width="400" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/top three.png">
            </p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Pain point 1: No actual discounts</span></h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Our business team found lots of goods with big discount for the 618 this year which relieved the pain points of "No actual discount" and "Can't find goods they need" that caused by too few goods. </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Meanwhile we emphasized that we had the lowest price at 618 promotions this year and promoted this selling point in both online and offline marketing approaches. For example, we marked most promotion goods in detailed page to address the discount, designed simple and crisp promotion slogan in banners, posters, advertisements etc., created promotion guide pages with all practical benefits users can get which spread widely through social media, and introduced the innovative pre-sale method which helped users pre-lock their favorite products and purchase them by instalment later with a much lower price. This sales strategy made users perceive actual benefits and more willing to purchase.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Pain point 2: Don't know when there is a promotion</span></h3>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Maximized and Effective Exposures for Venues</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">To find out how users get to know our promotions, I designed a site map of promotion venues with PM, business team and homepage team.</p>

            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/sitemap1.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">This site map describes the different content pieces in JD app and the relation between main venue, branch venue, purchasing flow and all the entrances for them. I marked all entrances for the main venue with red boxes. Grey nodes represent 1st-tier information object that can be easily found in app, white nodes are 2nd-tier objects which can be reached through their father nodes. Purchasing flow is another important flow needed to be consider in this site map to lead users to the promotions. </p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">With these internal and external exposures, users will hopefully get the feeling the promotion is easy to find and the content is connected in ways that match their expectations. When a user opens our app, he will find the promotions without efforts, or even before he opens this app, he already knows the promotions through both online and offline advertisements everywhere.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Another reason I built this site map is to raise the awareness of the overall flow of promotions in departments. We could build a promotion data analysis system based on this site map, monitoring and accumulating the data flow and optimizing our product.</p>
          
          <h3 class="pj-h3">Clear and spreadable Promotion Guide</h3>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">This spreadable page was meant to warm-up users by reminding them of coming venues and events, and lead external users to our app to participate promotions through social media (mainly by WeChat). We designed the festival into six sections that started at different times, which contained clear interest points and activity type. Thus, users can't miss any important activities when they see this guide.</p>


            <p>
              <img width="400" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/wireframe1.png">
            </p>
          
          <h3 class="pj-h3"><span style="color: #44c7b4;">Pain point 3: Can't find goods that I need</span></h3>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Customized Search</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I worked with app search engine team to optimized the search engine for promotions.  When a user searches a product, the search engine result page will show the venue it belongs to if it is in promotion, or show related venues in the same category at top. This helps users discover more options of the product they are looking for, especially those in promotion; it also lets the users notice the ongoing promotions.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Accessible Category Navigation</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I applied bottom navigation bar to all venues to make them consistent and easy to navigate for users. Users can quickly switch between a dozen different 1st-tier categories with hot and related venues to find the most suitable promotion activities for themselves to participate.</p>
            <p>
              <img width="500" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/navigation.png">
            </p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Progressive and Intelligent main venues</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Then it comes to the structure of main venues, I'll take the three periods of main venue based on different time and activities from Jun.1 to Jun 20 as an example (other branch venues are designed in a similar way).</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As the site map of main venues show, each main venue of different periods mainly contains four parts: activities (deep purple area), branch venues (middle purple area), brands (middle purple area) and items (Light purple area). The darker the area, the more interactive it is and more discount it has for the users, such as distributing coupons related to this venue directly, promotion games, spike items, or pre-sale items in the deep purple area. Then this area followed by venues, brands, and items in order to narrow down users' needs step by step, helping users browse more quickly and effortlessly.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">We also introduced Business Intelligence System to identify users' preferences and customized all venues for each individual. Thus, users will easily get hooked in venues by the content that are more appealing to them.</p>

            <p>
              <img width="420" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/sitemap2.png">
            </p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">To flesh out the structure, I designed four wireframes for main venues and branch venues.</p>

        <div class="greybox">
        <p class="pj1-p-normal">Some of the highlights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Content inventory and audit: Display the effective interest points (text, picture, animation effect) for each section within limited spaces.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Design different layout for each section: For example, when a user is browsing branch venue section, he wants to find out the venue type and discount content at first sight, if it is fit, he'll need to check the opening date and set a reminder later. Thus, I used three quarters of space to address the venue type and interest points by motivational text and pictures, and the rest of space were used for reminder function. While if the user is looking at an item, I'll emphasize picture, title, current price, original price and status of the item in spike zone, highlight picture, title, current price and discount brought by pre-sale of the pre-sale items, stress the importance of item category, picture, title and calls-to-action buying. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Design a common component layout for branch venue: more than twenty branch venues have their own detailed venue page, in order to keep them consistent and maximize development, design and test efficiency, I designed a component layout for all branch venues. Different branch venues could adjust the content by adding/deleting sections, setting the number of items for each section with different layout.</p>
            </li>

             <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Refine current component library: optimize content layout and micro interaction of coupon zone, spike zone and navigation of hot items to improve user experience.</p>
            </li>  
            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Make multi-platform experience consistent: I worked with tablet design team to adjust all promotion venues.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

            </p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Personal promotion management--My 618</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Due to so many interactions the users would have with our promotions, designing a personal space that display all the user's promotion records is vital. </p>

        <div class="greybox">
        <p class="pj1-p-normal">Some main parts of this page:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">As the whole promotion unfolded over time, I put the activity calendar as the most important content first. It showed the hot activities that would happen in seven days, with a link to promotion guide on the upper right corner.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">My reservations of venues and pre-sale items would be listed here with current status and calls-to-action button. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">You may also like: this part recommended an individual's favorite venues, brands or items by Business Intelligence System, aiming to make more conversions at this break point of their buying process.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

            </p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">What does it look like?</h2>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Chinese people like to use red, purple or other similar bright colors to decorate happy event. As you can see in the hi-fi's, we applied a lot of bright color with high saturation to our venues. I worked closely with visual designers and front-end developers to implement this project, making sure they deliver the same design intentions.</p>

        <p class="pj1-p-normal">Some main parts of this page:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">In order to keep up with the Business Intelligence System, our visual designers audited hundreds of pictures for main venues.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">I really loved the visual design of promotion guide! The visual designers and I brainstormed to decide to use the concept of theme parks to wrap this guide. Each venue period stands for a unique and vivid style of theme park.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p class="pj1-p-normal">Adjusted the animation effect with front-end developers. For example, we personated the red packet to attract more attention in the coupon zone, the red packet would wave its arm and drop gold coins around. It took a lot of adjustments to make its motion natural.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <p>
              <img width="1000" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./jdvenues_files/visual.png">
            </p>

        <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">How can I do better in the future?</h2>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Build a better data analysis system</h3>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">By establishing the site map of overall promotion flow, we hope to observe and accumulate the data over time to find the user drop points, helping us optimize our project in the future. Hopefully, we would build a visualized promotion data analysis system which provide more data-driven insights for our design.</p>

          <h3 class="pj-h3">Establish best practices for promotion visual design</h3>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As a newly established team, we had so much work to do in designing better promotion venues and games. These promotion products involve a lot of marketing and communication knowledge, which could be tested and optimized by scientific methods, such as eye-tracking, A/B test, usability testing and data analytics.  For example, if we have time and resources, we could test several layouts of branch venues, the one that gets more interest of users, conveys clearer marketing information and generates more conversion would become our best practice of branch venue design. By continuously accumulating more best practices, we will be able to provide a more memorable user experience.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">After I joined the team, I conducted several usability testing to refine the promotion games and it benefited a lot. I tried to analyze the data of several promotion games as well, establishing conversion model, user funnel and analyze the reasons, hoping to design better games of the same series (you could find the practice result in my other projects). I'm enrolled in eye-tracking class this semester which provides me a good opportunity to learn more about it. Hopefully I can become a better UX designer armed with scientific data in the near future.</p>
