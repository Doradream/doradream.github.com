          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Why I designed this research</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">China’s online education industry has grown rapidly in the past few years, and analysts believe the country could become one of the world’s most vibrant online education markets in the future. The market is likely to grow 20 per cent annually, reaching 270 billion yuan (US$41 billion) in 2019, up from 156 billion yuan in 2016. Globally the online education market will rise to US$190 billion by 2019, statistics from iResearch and Decebo showed. This means big opportunities for online education companies in China.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">In 2016, Dianping app established an education channel, which is also a platform form. Its core function is to match teaching institutions and adult learners in four major areas: higher education, vocational training, language learning and hobby education. At the beginning of 2017, we have preliminary products, but we are still exploring how to optimize our products and improve the user experience.</p>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">How I designed this questionnaire</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Project Plan: online survey, web analytics, interview and building persona and journey map. This article mainly focuses on the online survey phase.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">As the research initiator, I designed an online survey with a product manager’s help, and then analyzed data and reported findings in education department.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Try to define these questions to find and appeal to current users:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="pj1-p-normal">1) Who are our users?</p></li>
            <li><p class="pj1-p-normal">2) How do the users make decisions when choosing a course?</p></li>

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Questionnaire construction</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">I used basic AIDA model (Awareness→ Interest→ Desire→ Action) to present users purchasing process. We focused on the pre-purchase stage (i.e. attention, interest and desire) as our product team’s priority optimization at that time.</p>
          <p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Then I collected and designed questions from PM and business department by conducting a preliminary research. A questionnaire piloting followed to fix some confusing questions.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The survey is administrated by app push notifications to 4.95 million education channel users who has recent purchase, booking, high preference or visit in last 180 days. Scan QR code or visit this website to view questionnaire in Chinese.</p>

          <div class="w-col w-col-9">
            
            <p class="pj1-p-normal">From May 8 to June 2, 2017, we recovered 583 responses, among which 453 are valid sample data and 303 are used for user group analysis by using cross analysis, frequency analysis and k-means cluster analysis.</p>
            <p class="pj1-p-normal">After cleaning the data, I compared it to big data user report of Education Channel, the overall characteristics of sample data are similar to those of the big data user report. Meanwhile, the survey is administrated by app push notifications and targets on users who are interested in or have participated in our educational products. As a result, this survey cannot cover churn users and other potential users.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">According to business needs, I divided users by their learning goals and subjects with Tableau which uses the k-means algorithm for clustering. When k equals five, the cluster is aligned with business needs at a reasonable level.</p>

          When it comes to what users care most about a course, the top three factors that all groups mention are teaching effectiveness, price and course content.

          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">What we plan to do about the survey result</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Combined the results with available app analytics data to find more insights. For example, how many institutions dose a typical user view before purchasing, which section dose he tap most often to approach our service in app, which page does he stay longer and check more sections among course page, institution page and teacher page?</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Interview users of these four groups to find out the reason behind their attitudes and behaviors.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="words_and_image">
          <h2 class="pj1-head2 pj1-brief">Make a difference</h2>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal"><strong style="color: #555;">Expand design influence by advocating the result to the whole department</strong></p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">This survey laid the foundation of building our persona and arose the awareness of our users in non-design teams as our design team’s first try. As an UX designer, I used to attend the weekly product meeting to understand real-time product trends. They listened attentively to my preaching of the survey result at the weekly meeting because it was exactly what the educational product department needed. I used powerful instrument--data visualization (e.g. dashboard, infographic and visual graphics) to help stakeholders understand and address user needs. The product team considered this survey helpful for their future product planning.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal"><strong style="color: #555;">Try to put the research results into practical activities</strong></p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">The business department tried an offline activity called Knows Market which gathered all of our popular educational institutions in music, art and other hobby field and provided on-site trail courses. Users can sign up online and participate offline. It is a successful try to reach our primary user group as they care a lot about trail course and teaching effectiveness.</p>

          <p><img width="70%" class="j1-image-mindchange" src="./project_survey_files/knows market.png"></p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #999999;"><i>Knows Market activity</i></span></p>
        </div>


        <div id="words">
          <p class="pj1-p-normal"><strong style="color: #555;">Increase recovery rate to make best use of the data</strong></p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Usually the common recovery rate of online questionnaire in our app is one in a thousand, while we got a low recovery rate of 1.2 responses per ten thousand. The result would be much better if I could strive for better distribution channels of push notification since our design team hadn’t cooperated with internal messaging team for a long time. A better distribution timing would also make a difference. I investigated the UV pattern for educational channel users and selected the peak period of visits during a week, but I ignored other competitors at the same distribution channel who might send different questionnaires to same users.</p>


          <p class="pj1-p-normal"><strong style="color: #555;">Design the questionnaire better and faster</strong></p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Because of the time limit, I designed this survey by interviewing two PMs who had collected possible questions from educational institutions. Interviewing some extreme users and analyzing user behavioral data would give me more inspirations for the designing phase of survey.</p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">Making sure all possible supports and resources that my research needs are ready before actually starting the project would accelerate the whole process.</p>

          <p class="pj1-p-normal"><strong style="color: #555;">Use a more holistic consumer’s purchase decision model</strong></p>
          <p class="pj1-p-normal">A major deficiency of AIDA purchase model is the absence of post-purchase effects such as satisfaction, repeat patronage behavior or participating in online product reviews, though this model met our needs of re-purchase stage at that time. The purchasing decision model (Problem Recognition →Information search →Alternative evaluation →Purchase decision →Post-purchase), combined with the internet’s impact on buying process, is a more comprehensive model that will communicate more insights of the whole customer experience.</p>
